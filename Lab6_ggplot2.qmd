## Task: Economist scatterplot

The aim of this challenge is to recreate the plot below originally published in The Economist. The graph is a scatterplot showing the relationship between Corruption Index and Human Development Index for various countries.

![Plot from The Economist](https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/imagecache/original-size/20111210_WOC210.gif)

Load packages:

```{r}
#| message: FALSE

library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggrepel)
library(patchwork)

```

Load data:

```{r}

ec <- read.csv("data/data_economist.csv",header = T, row.names = 1)
head(ec)

```

Make sure that the fields are of the correct type. The x-axis field ‘CPI’ and the y-axis field ‘HDI’ must be of numeric type. The categorical field ‘Region’ must be of Factor type.

```{r}

str(ec)

```

We need to first modify the region column. The current values in the ‘Region’ field are:

```{r}

unique(ec$Region)

```

But, the categories on the plot are different and need to be changed as follows:

* EU W. Europe --> OECD
* Americas --> Americas
* Asia Pacific --> Asia & Oceania
* East EU Cemt Asia --> Central & Eastern Europe
* MENA --> Middle East & North Africa
* SSA --> Sub-Saharan Africa

Don't forget about the line breaks like in the original plot.

```{r}

ec$Region <- factor(ec$Region,levels = c("EU W. Europe",
                                "Americas",
                                "Asia Pacific",
                                "East EU Cemt Asia",
                                "MENA",
                                "SSA"),
                     labels = c("OECD",
                                "Americas",
                                "Asia &\nOceania",
                                "Central &\nEastern Europe",
                                "Middle East &\nNorth Africa",
                                "Sub-Saharan\nAfrica"))


```

```{r}

levels(ec$Region)

```

```{r}

ggplot(ec, aes(x = CPI, y = HDI)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Region), shape = 21, stroke = 1) +
  labs(x = 'Corruption Perceptions Index, 2011 (10=Least corrupt)',
       y = 'Human Development Index, 2011 (1=best)',
       title = 'Corruption and human development') +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#23576E","#099FDB","#29B00E", "#208F84","#F55840","#924F3E")) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', formula = y ~ log(x),
              color = 'red', se = F) +
  theme_minimal()
  

```
